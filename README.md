# puzzle-share-vue
This will be a puzzle share app project my son and I are preparing to begin, and it is going to be a web-based program that allows users to trade puzzles with friends and neighbors. They will (might??) also be able to document their own puzzle history as well as track that of their friends.

We'll be using VueJS and Laravel as the two frameworks and this will combine most of our software development skills to date. He is a talented high-school senior and I’m a 40-year-old junior developer. This will be his first big project and the first time for both of us collaborating with someone else. We will be working on different computers and will use Git and GitHub for version control. We'll see how it goes.: )

We are going to attempt to create this app with the following features:
- Login and Registration
- Local search for puzzles by size and tags
- Puzzles Completed
- User Inventory (What you have) and Personal Puzzle History
- Puzzle Information (who, when, average completion time, memories, completion picture, fastest time, verification of all the pieces, glasses of wine consumed, …)
- User Messaging (???)

This is an ambitious project but one that I feel we can complete, I guess time will tell…
